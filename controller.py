#Controller
'''Reasoning behind design:''' 
'''The Client, MyHandler classes and periodic_poll function control the flow 
in the chat system. The Client class either sends messages to the server or prints them
on the view (this is the definition of what a controller should do). MyHandler class 
does the exact same thing but with the Server/Listener. '''
